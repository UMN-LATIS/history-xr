# History Under the Floorboards exhibit

At Historic Fort Snelling, visitors will find the History Under the Floorboards exhibit in the Officers’ Quarters which explores what we learn from archaeology at Fort Snelling. To augment what you see in the exhibit, we are creating annotated 3D models of some of the many artifacts found at the site. One of our goals is to show how these items were part of Native American and African American experience in this place. We will be adding more links to explore this digital content over the summer of 2022.  In the meantime, [try out our demo model](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/snelling-artifacts-v1-79b13a26437e471eadc2ae2220a18cb0) with multiple artifacts.  This is a work in progress, and will update as we add annotations and other interpretive content.
