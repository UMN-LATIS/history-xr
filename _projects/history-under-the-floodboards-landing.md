# History Under the Floorboards exhibit

At Historic Fort Snelling, visitors will find the History Under the Floorboards exhibit in the Officers’ Quarters which explores what we learn from archaeology at Fort Snelling.  To augment what you see in the exhibit, we’ve created annotated 3D models of some of the many artifacts found at the site.  We will be adding links to explore this digital content over the summer of 2022.

This content is being developed through a partnership with the Minnesota Historical Society Archaeology Department!
