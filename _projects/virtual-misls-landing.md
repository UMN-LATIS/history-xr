# Virtual MISLS

<!-- ![virtual-misls](/assets/img/virtual-misls/hall-fullwidth.png) -->

Virtual MISLS is a virtual reality tour of the Military Intelligence Service Language School at Fort Snelling, Minnesota.

During World War II, the MISLS trained soldiers in the Japanese language to aid the war effort. Since then, many of buildings have fallen into disrepair. We created this virtual reality tour to enable people to immerse themselves in a part of history that is often under-represented at Fort Snelling.
