## About

HistoryXR is a repository for digital heritage projects built by the University of Minnesotaâ€™s Advanced Imaging Services for Objects and Spaces (AISOS) lab, in collaboration with faculty, students, community groups and historical organizations.  We work especially with the department of Anthropology, and the graduate program in Heritage Studies and Public History.

HistoryXR is a collaborative effort! You can learn more about the folks who helped make our work possible by visiting their websites.
