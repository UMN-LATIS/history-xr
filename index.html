                <p>Welcome to HistoryXR!  Here we host digital public history projects at various stages that are produced in collaboration with the Minnesota Historical Society and various community organizations.  Our pilot projects are focused on Historic Fort Snelling at Bdote.</p>
<p>What does the XR mean?  It is shorthand for extended reality - we use 3D modeling, virtual reality and augmented reality as a way to get visitors and users engaged in historical sites and stories.  These platforms allow us to enrich existing historic places with all their layered, complex stories.</p>
<p>Please use the links below to explore our projects to date.  These are works in progress, so check back with us for updates and new additions.</p>
